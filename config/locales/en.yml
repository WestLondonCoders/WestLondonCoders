# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  index_introductions:
    events: Welcome to our new events planner. We're still testing this and haven't
      announced them yet. Feel free to RSVP to any of the events here.
    hackrooms: Hackrooms are a way to bring together people with shared interests
      or goals. It could be a group of beginners learning HTML, or some Pythonists
      building an app, or both of those things.
    languages: We've used the word languages here, but these can be any tools or frameworks.
      Languages can have primary hackrooms, where that language is the main focus,
      or secondary hackrooms where it's used as a sideline.
    organisers: Our organisers help make sure everyone is comfortable at our meetups,
      organise hackrooms and help setup events. Interested in helping?
    posts: Anyone can write posts at West London Coders. Writing about development
      or your experience at our meetups is a great way to express yourself, provoke
      discussion and get involved in the developer community.
